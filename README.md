Validating data is a common task that Java developers have to do and it is spread throughout all layers (from client to database) of an application.
This common practice is time-consuming, error prone, and hard to maintain in the long run.
In addition, some of these constraints are so frequently used that they could be considered standard (check for a null value, its size, its range etc.).
It would be good to be able to centralize these constraints in one place and share them across layers.
That's when [Bean Validation](https://beanvalidation.org) comes into play.

In this [fascicle](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Bean-Validation-2-0-fascicle-ebook/dp/B07B2KJ41R) will you will learn Bean Validation and use its different APIs to apply constraints on a bean, validate all sorts of constraints, write your own constraints and a few advanced topics such as integrating Bean Validation with other frameworks (JPA, JAX-RS, CDI, Spring).
